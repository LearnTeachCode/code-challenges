* collapse intervals
  Given a collection of intervals, return the minimal collection of
  non-overlapping intervals that cover the same points.

  Example:

  : [[1, 3], [5, 8], [2, 5]]  --> [[1, 5], [5, 8]]

  Assume the intervals are half-open =[a, b)=. That is, the
  starting element is included, the ending element is /not/
  included: =[1, 4) -> [1, 2, 3]=

** Bonus implementation ideas:
   1. Write versions for other interval types (open-open,
      closed-closed, open-closed). If you have a preference, justify
      it.
   4. Write a data structure for a streaming version that takes one or
      more intervals and updates the current set of minimal intervals.
   5. Analyze the space/time complexity of your implementation.
   6. /Note:/ I solved a very practical problem with this algorithm a
      few weeks ago. Demonstrate (or describe) an application of your
      function on a real "business" problem.
