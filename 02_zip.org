* zip
  Write =zip=: a function that iterates over two arrays/iterables at the same time.

  : zip([1, 2], [3, 4]) --> [[1, 3], [2, 4]]

  Consider corner cases. Handle more than two arrays if possible. input/output format is up to you.

  If you need, check docs on the zip functions in, say, lodash or python or Haskell for the desired behavior.

** What is the desired behavior when one array is longer than the other?
   You choose (and ideally justify the design decision). One option: in python, it stops on the shortest and another function =zip_longest= does the opposite.
